            1. Upload your video file (supported formats: mp4, mov, avi)  
            2. Wait for processing - this may take a few moments depending on video length  
            3. The result will be displayed as an animated GIF showing object detections

            - Real-time object detection using YOLOv8n model  
            - Automatic conversion of video to annotated GIF format  
            - Support for multiple common video formats

            ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
            - Processing is limited to 400 frames maximum  
              - Longer videos will be automatically truncated  
              - For best results, trim long videos before uploading  
            - YOLOv8n is optimized for speed with good accuracy  
            - Works best on clear, well-lit footage  
            - Can detect 80 object classes, including:  
              - Common objects (person, car, chair, etc.)  
              - Animals (dog, cat, bird, etc.)

            - Resolution: Original video resolution is retained  
              - Very high-resolution videos may process slower
